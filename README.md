# Craq Mod

## Installation
Go to [Releases](https://wip), download the latest mod and put it in your mods folder.  
This is not a client mod, as it introduces new items/blocks. If you want to use it on a server, the server should also have this mod installed.

## What is this mod?
This mod was made for fun by [Ardyon](https://github.com/AidenRaaphorst), [Luuk](https://github.com/luuk353) and [Marco](https://github.com/marcosmug).  
We wanted to see what we could make.

## Why?
School gave us a choice on what to do for a project, and we chose to make a Minecraft mod. 
Also, just because, lmao.
